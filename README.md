# Welcome to Tesfamichael’s Space

What I do:  
I don’t just build Android apps — I create experiences that fit in your user’s pocket and stay in their heart.  
Code speaks louder than promises. I write mine in Kotlin + Java.  

Current Mission:  
`Transforming wireframes into working, reliable Android apps — with pixel-perfect UI and buttery-smooth UX.`  
`Mastering Jetpack Compose for cleaner, faster, future-proof code.`  

You can talk to me about: 
-  Android development — from zero to Play Store
-  Git & clean workflows
-  Designing app architecture that scales
-  Turning your idea into a working MVP

Fun fact:
Some people write code. I design solutions disguised as apps.
