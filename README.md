# 👋 Welcome to Tesfamichael’s Space

🛠 What I do:  
I don’t just build Android apps — I create experiences that fit in your user’s pocket and stay in their heart.  
Code speaks louder than promises. I write mine in Kotlin + Java.  

⚡ Current Mission:  
`Transforming wireframes into working, reliable Android apps — with pixel-perfect UI and buttery-smooth UX.`  
`Mastering Jetpack Compose for cleaner, faster, future-proof code.`  

💬 You can talk to me about: 
- 🚀 Android development — from zero to Play Store
- 🔧 Git & clean workflows
- 🧠 Designing app architecture that scales
- 🤝 Turning your idea into a working MVP

⚡ Fun fact:
Some people write code. I design solutions disguised as apps.
